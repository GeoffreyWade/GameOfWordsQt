# GameOfWordsQt
This is project is word game application coded in C++/Qt in the spring of 2014.The application was initially built as a project with the Qt4.8 framework. Since then the application has been rebuilt
with Qt versions 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and prior to this commit Qt5.5. The application consists of three files:

main.cpp
gameofwords.cpp
gameofwords.h
WordData/TheHundredGrand.txt

Due to the fact that the application has been built and tested with many versions of Qt, different Interactive 
Development Environments, and with many operating system types:
Windows, Linux, MacOSx, and Solaris; the requester can download and build the project themselves.

To do so, instead of opening a .pro file (which I have not commited) within a Netbeans/Qt IDE, 
create a new Qt Application project.

It should be noted that Windows users will have to make adjustments to name space of the .qrc file.
